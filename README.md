# Mine Sweeper

I should think about how I am going to represent a cell and how I will hold the
value of neighboring mines.

I think i will use the [bubblezone](https://github.com/lrstanley/bubblezone) for
the clicking of the cells

I should just spend time doing a rough design then seeing if that will work
